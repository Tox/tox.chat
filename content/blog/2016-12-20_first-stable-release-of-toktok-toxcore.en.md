Good news everyone!

The first stable version of TokTok Toxcore, 0.1.0, [got
released](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/releases/tag/v0.1.0). This
release will be API compatible with other 0.1.x releases, until 0.2.0 is
released, which will break the API.

This marks the first stable release of TokTok Toxcore and is an exciting
milestone on the road to future Toxcore improvements.

The packages of TokTok Toxcore are now available in the stable and
nightly streams on pkg.tox.chat.

Most clients are switching to using TokTok Toxcore as their Toxcore
library. Antidote and ÂµTox clients already use TokTok Toxcore, qTox has
gained support for TokTok Toxcore and will use it in the next release,
and Antox and Toxic are in the process of gaining support for TokTok
Toxcore.

Thanks to [iphy, grayhatter, nurupo and
others](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/compare/v0.0.1...TokTok:v0.1.1)
for their hard work on Toxcore, as well as thanks to Encrypt for the
work on packaging it.

TokTok Toxcore version follows the rules of [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org/). The API promise of x.y.z version is
defined to be the same as the Semantic Versioning API promise of x.y.z
with leading zeros stripped, meaning 0.1.0 has the same API promise as
1.0.0.

While we were being excited with the 0.1.0 release, TokTok Toxcore has
already [released 0.1.1
version](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/releases/tag/v0.1.1). The
current release cycle of patch versions is approximately one per week,
so they keep incrementing relatively fast.

Happy Toxing!
