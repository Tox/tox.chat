In October the Tox developer community will be holding a conference in
Vienna. Join us as we talk about the progress we have made during the
last 12 months with Tox and other security related topics. There will be
lots of talks and other cool things to see.

For more details join the
[\#toxcon2018](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#toxcon2018) IRC
channel on Freenode and contact *robinli*, *sudden6* or *zoff99*.

More information will be revealed in a future post.
