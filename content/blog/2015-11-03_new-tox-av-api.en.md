That's right, today is the big day! After months of work, the new API
for Tox A/V has finally been merged into toxcore.

Changes:

-   A new API, similar to toxcore.
-   A better adaptive bit rate algorithm.

Nothing too surprising for the average user, but great news for
developers.

The reason for this blog post is the fact that this update will
break the protocol, which means you will have to update your clients.
Most of our main clients are ready and if all goes well you should
receive an update later today. These include: uTox, qTox, Toxic and
Antidote.

Happy Toxing!
