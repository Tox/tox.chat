I'm sad to announce this, but we have to shut down the [Debian and
Ubuntu package repository](https://pkg.tox.chat/debian/) due to it being
unmaintained and thus having outdated or even possibly broken packages.
It has been several months since our last package maintainer maintained
any packages and our search for a new package maintainer didn't result
in anything. The package repository is planned to be shut down sometime
in the first half of March. The package repository might return in the
future if there would be enough people willing to maintain it, but for
now we have no choice but to close it.
