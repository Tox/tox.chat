*(Tox Dev Talks is a series of weekly meetings that bring the Tox
developer community together to share ideas, progress,
and miscellaneous chatter. They take place Saturdays at 16:00 UTC.)*

Tox Dev Talks are back after a week-long hiatus due to scheduling
difficulties. As we had irungentoo on hand, we spent a lot of time on
core issues. Here's a bit of what was discussed.

-   **Tox core**
    -   **Offline messaging**
        -   The student who was implementing it disappeared. irungentoo
            will be taking over if he has time.
    -   **Friendly names / DNS replacement?**
        -   No real solution was brought up that would be better than
            what we have now. That said, DNS will remain optional for
            clients and not a Tox core feature.
    -   **irungentoo's to-do list**
        -   Improve file transfers.
        -   Write proper documentation for the code.
        -   In general, fix bugs and/or finish some features that aren’t
            done.
    -   **New groupchats**
        -   Currently stalled due to requiring some significant core
            changes.
    -   **A/V revamp**
        -   Currently waiting on client support and some important bug
            fixes.

<!-- -->

-   **Packaging**
    -   qTox binaries are finally available again (Windows and Linux
        static)
    -   An APT repository will be coming soon.

<!-- -->

-   **Client news**
    -   µTox
        -   New A/V is complete and waiting on aforementioned bug fixes.
        -   grayhatter is currently working to improve the UI.
    -   qTox
        -   New A/V is almost done, audio works, webcam works, streaming
            desktop doesn’t work and the button functionality still
            needs to be implemented.
        -   tux3 is no longer dead, and has given access to the main
            repository to DaSpirit and others while he catches up on
            things.
    -   Antox
        -   There is currently a naming dispute with the original
            author.
            -   The current developer, subliun, will continue using the
                Antox name.

<!-- -->

-   **Other things worth mentioning**
    -   As some people aren't happy with the design of tox.chat,
        installgen2 is going to redesign the site. He will show what he
        came up with at the next meeting.

If you want to participate in the next Tox Dev Talk, feel free to drop
in next week. We hope to keep a stable schedule, but if that doesn't
happen, we will let you know on [the calendar](/events).
