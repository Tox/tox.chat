This year's ToxCon was super fun, thanks to everyone who attended it!

If you have missed the event, [list of
talks](https://tox.fahrplan.zoff.cc/booklet.html), [talk slides and some
photos](https://github.com/Tox/events/tree/master/toxcon2018) from the
event are available online. No videos are available as it was decided
not to record the talks.

We are planning to hold another ToxCon the next year, so keep an eye for
announcements. If you are working on anything fun with Tox and want to
share it with the world, consider giving a talk at the next ToxCon -- we
would be happy to host your talk.

Here are a couple of the photos from the event.
