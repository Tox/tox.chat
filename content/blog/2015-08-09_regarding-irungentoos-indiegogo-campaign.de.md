[irungentoo](https://github.com/irungentoo) (our main toxcore developer)
has started [a personal fundraising
campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/toxcore-development) that
would allow him to dedicate a month of full time work to Tox
development. Although this has already been posted
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projecttox),
[reddit](https://reddit.com/r/projecttox) and
[IRC](https://wiki.tox.chat/users/community#irc), we have decided to
give it a mention here as well, both in order to support our fellow
developer, and to clear up some misunderstandings.

Quite a few people have asked if this is an official Tox fundraising
campaign. It is not. This is something that irungentoo is doing on his
own, separate from the project; all raised funds will go directly to him
to be used however he sees best fit. We mentioned in our [previous blog
post](https://blog.tox.chat/2015/07/current-situation-3/) that we
wouldn't be taking any donations as a project until we have set up a
proper organization with an emphasis on transparency and protection of
assets. This is still the case, however we also mentioned that
individual developers are free to take personal donations, which is what
this is.

We apologize if this has caused any confusion, and hope that this has
sufficiently cleared up any misunderstandings.
