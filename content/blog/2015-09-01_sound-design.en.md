As I'm sure you are all aware, Tox has grown tremendously in terms of UI
and usability, yet client sounds are still somewhat lacking.

We are looking for people to help out with creating sounds for clients
(ringtones, notification sounds, etc). No programming knowledge is
required. Just join us in \#tox-dev on Freenode (here is
[webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#tox-dev) for those of
you without an IRC client).

Thanks!
