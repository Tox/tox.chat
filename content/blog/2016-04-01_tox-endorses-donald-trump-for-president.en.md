The Tox project is proud to endorse Donald Trump for president of the
United States.

We believe that a Trump presidency will lead to an increased amount of
Tox users and that it will help the privacy movement become much
stronger than it is now.

If you support privacy we ask that you vote for Donald Trump and do
everything you can to make him become the next president. President
Trump will help make privacy software great again.

Trump 2016 - because together we can make privacy great again.
