As promised, here is more information on ToxCon 2018.

Tox developer community will be holding the conference from Friday,
October 12th, to Sunday, October 14th -- a 3 day event, at [Metalab
Vienna](https://twitter.com/metalabvie), a hackerspace [located in the
heart of Vienna, Austria](https://pretix.eu/ZMetalab/ToxCon2018/). We
have many talks prepared for you: from the progress Tox has made in the
last 12 months, to security-related and other interesting topics. The
the full schedule of the event [is available
online](https://tox.fahrplan.zoff.cc/booklet.html) and there is also an
[Android app](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.zoffcc.fahrplan.toxcon/)
that you can use to get updates if more talks get added.

If you would like to learn more about Tox, meet the developers, do some
live hacking, or just socialize, then this is the event for you. [The
tickets are free](https://pretix.eu/ZMetalab/ToxCon2018/) and you have
an option to buy a sponsored ticket or a ToxCon T-shirt. All money from
the sponsored tickets and the T-shirt sales will go towards a dinner for
the speakers, and, if there is money left, T-shirts to give away.

For questions about booking, travel arrangements, talks, or anything
related to the event feel free to join the
[\#toxcon2018](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#toxcon2018) IRC
channel on Freenode and contact one of the event organizers: *robinli*,
