Hey guys, installgen2 here, I've been working a little bit on what I
hope to be Tox's new website one day. Quite a few users have complained
about the current site, for reasons which are listed:

-   Proprietary JS
-   Code nobody wants to work on
-   Broken scrolling (for a lot of browsers)
-   No mobile support
-   Design inconsistent with the rest of Tox
-   Extremely heavy resource usage
-   Everything listed [here](https://github.com/Tox/Tox-Website/issues)
-   [This](https://github.com/Tox/Tox-Website/issues/8) issue raises
    some points too

So, as nobody else to my knowledge had started developing a new site, I
started work on one. Unfortunately, I don't have the time or the
experience to continue development on my own, and I need help if I want
to continue. I'm asking everyone with an interest in web-development and
design, to help me out with the new site.

Anybody interested, please either join our [\#tox-dev IRC channel on
Freenode](https://wiki.tox.chat/users/community#irc?), or contribute
directly to [the repo on
GitHub](https://github.com/installgen2/tox.chat). You can see my current
progress at <http://beta.tox.chat>. Thanks!
