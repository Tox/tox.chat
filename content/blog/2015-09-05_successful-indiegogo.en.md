We are happy to announce that irungentoo's personal Indiegogo campaign
has been successfully funded!

As you may already know, irungentoo has been running a [personal
fundraiser]({filename}2015-08-09_regarding-irungentoos-indiegogo-campaign.en.md),
to allow himself to dedicate a month of full time work to Tox
development. This fundraiser reached
its \$5,000 USD goal with 6 hours left on the clock. At the time of
writing, a total of **\$5,785** has been
raised by **217** funders.

The Tox Project would like to give a big "Thank You!" to all that
donated, as well as to all of Tox's supporters for making this happen,
and helping to raise even more money than irungentoo's original goal.

irungentoo would like to say to everyone:

> Thank you, everyone, for making this fundraiser a success. If you
> bought a perk please send me the related stuff, it will be put into
> the repository when I collect most of them. If you donated bitcoin in
> an amount equal or greater to the value of one of the perks and want
> to receive that perk, just email me at **irungentoo@gmail.com** with
> proof (e.g. a message signed with your bitcoin address key).
>
> Unless something happens (computer stops working, etc.), I will be
> starting my full time work on toxcore on September 8. I will start by
> writing toxcore documentation, which will take a long time but is
> important and might invite more people to contribute to toxcore and
> make sure that Tox does not die if I get hit by a bus. Thank you for
> making sure that Tox will become even stronger.
>
> Sincerely,
> irungentoo

We'll be sitting down with irungentoo very soon to develop a roadmap for
the toxcore library. Once it has been developed, we'll publish it, and
you'll be able to track development progress as it happens.

Thanks again,

The Tox Project
