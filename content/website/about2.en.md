# The Tox Project

Tox began a few years ago, in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks regarding NSA
spying activity. The idea was to create an instant messaging application that
ran without requiring the use of central servers. The system would be
distributed, peer-to-peer, and end-to-end encrypted, with no way to disable any
of the encryption features; at the same time, the application would be easily
usable by the layperson with no practical knowledge of cryptography or
distributed systems. During the Summer of 2013 a small group of developers from
all around the globe formed and began working on a library implementing the Tox
protocol. The library provides all of the messaging and encryption facilities,
and is completely decoupled from any user-interface; for an end-user to make
use of Tox, they need a Tox client. Fast-forward a few years to today, and
there exist several independent Tox client projects, and the original Tox core
library implementation continues to improve. Tox (both core library and
clients) has thousands of users, hundreds of contributors, and the project
shows no sign of slowing down.

Tox is a FOSS (Free and Open Source) project. All Tox code is open source and
all development occurs in the open. Tox is developed by volunteer developers
who spend their free time on it, believing in the idea of the project. Tox is
not a company or any other legal organization. Currently we don't accept
donations as a project, but you are welcome to reach out to developers
individually.
