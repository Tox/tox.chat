# tox.chat
The future website for Tox!

## Contributing


### TODOs
Check out our [issues](https://github.com/Tox/tox.chat/issues) page for all bugs and suggestions alike

### Cloning
We make use of the Font-Awesome icon pack as a git submodule. In order to make sure this is downloaded, use ```--recursive``` when cloning.

### Guidelines
 - No feature or element of the website should ___require___ Javascript or a backend. Using frontend Javascript for enhancements is acceptable.
 - Avoid making the site execute 3.5MB of proprietary Javascript on scroll event.
 - Please use icons from the Font-Awesome pack if available.
 - No official stances on "third party" programs. For example, no "recommended clients". If you want to add something like this, please bring it up with @zer0-one first.
 - Before working on fixing an issue, please double check there's not already an ongoing fork fixing it.
 - When fixing an issue, post a comment saying that you are doing so, to save others the confusion.
 - Be sure not to mix up indentation, we try to stick to 4-wide tabs.

### Pull requests
If you want your pull request to be merged quickly, you need to make it easy to review.

Include a short and long description, screenshot (or recording if needed) documenting the changes, and some chocolate for @installgen2.
